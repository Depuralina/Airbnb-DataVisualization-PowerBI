# Lisbon Airbnb's - Data Visualization


In a scenario where the diversity of accommodation options reaches unprecedented levels, choosing where to stay has become a vital component of the travel experience. With the rise of Airbnb, travelers are faced with a wide range of options, but the question remains: how can we make information easier to visualize and ensure that each choice meets each user's expectations?


## Problem for guests
Airbnb can be described as an online platform where ordinary people make their spaces available as accommodation for tourists (Airbnb, 2020a). These accommodations can include entire houses or apartments, individual rooms (where the owner also resides), and even less conventional spaces such as sofas. The variety is remarkable, ranging from modest configurations to luxurious environments, providing a wide range of options for guests. This diversity of accommodations offered by Airbnb contributes to unique hosting experiences, adapted to the different profiles and preferences of users. This platform emerged in 2008, created by two university students in California. Until then, the platform evolved and reached millions of users around the world, until the COVID-19 pandemic. Where Airbnb guest and user values ​​have fallen drastically.
Following the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in a sharp decline in the number of guests across the world, the hotel sector is now gradually recovering, approaching pre-pandemic levels. However, this recovery process occurs in a delicate global economic context, marked by notable inflation, which implies a constant reassessment of consumers' financial choices.

## Problem for managers
Airbnb managers face significant challenges in selecting and managing hosts, making it essential to address issues such as fraud and misconduct. The possibility of hosts providing false information, adopting deceptive practices or demonstrating inappropriate behavior requires a rigorous approach on the part of managers.
The reputation and image of the Airbnb brand are intrinsically linked to the behavior of hosts. Misconduct by a few can undermine guest trust and tarnish the platform's global reputation. Therefore, managers have a crucial responsibility to ensure that only trustworthy and ethical hosts are featured on the platform, preserving users' trust.
Additionally, ensuring quality and compliance of listed properties is a priority. Managers must make sure that these properties meet established quality standards and are in ideal conditions to guarantee a good stay for guests. This includes analyzing several factors such as average response time, verified price (potentially Airbnb hosts may be unduly increasing the price depending on location), analysis of guest reviews and other relevant aspects to ensure a positive experience for guests. .
